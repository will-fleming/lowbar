# Lowbar Part 2 (advanced)

In this sprint, you will continue to re-implement the Underscore library. This time, you will need to setup an NPM project from scratch, create the files and directories you need, and set up your test environment. Make sure you also install the NPM package `husky` and use a `precommit` script in your `package.json` file that lints your code using ESLint. Use your previous lowbar sprint code base as a reminder if you need to.

This time, the methods you need to implement are a little trickier. Many of them are utility methods for functions, such as `throttle` which stops a function being called more often than requested. Your experience with higher order functions, recursion and searching and sorting algorithms this week may come in useful!
 

## Tasks

1. indexOf (again, this time with a binary search)
2. once
3. memoize
4. delay
5. shuffle
6. invoke
7. sortBy (NB the Underscore library uses the native JavaScript sort but feel free to use your sort algorithm!)
8. zip
9. sortedIndex
10. flatten
11. intersection
12. difference
13. throttle
